# PyBrowser
This is a fully working python web browser which is coded with python, python is not required for this application because it is a python file ported to an exe with auto-py-to-exe :) Thought github doenst like the fact that its 106 mb so i have to give you guys a mediafire link :( https://www.mediafire.com/file/rjg7c4niydovi0z/PyBrowse.exe/file

WARNING, THE EXE FILE IS FLAGGED AS MALWARE ON VIRUSTOTAL, IT IS A FALSE POSITIVE, IF YOU ARE SCARED, DOWNLOAD THE SOURCE CODE AND YOU WILL FIND THE UNCOMPILED PYTHON FILE WHICH IS THE SAME AS THE EXE EXCEPT IT REQUIRES PYTHON, YOU CAN LOOK AT ITS CODE.
